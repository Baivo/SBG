#### [ProjectSP - The Server Points system](/ProjectSP/)
An attempt to create a more in-depth, engaging and flexible player reward system.
Currently in it's infancy, but is planned to be stored against a SQL server independent of any MC focus or dependency. 
The final product will creep well outside Denizen in it's scope, but is aimed to provide a recognition and reward system that isn't tied to a single game, application or server.
