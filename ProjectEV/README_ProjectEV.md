Project attempts to create a vanilla-compatible spiritual successor to the gameplay style provided in the Tekkit Classic 1.2.5 modpack. 
Primarily focussed on the gameplay loop and flexibility provided by the EE2 mod, though will hopefully include many of the other notable features. 

This includes, from memory + what I consider reasonably possible: 

EE2 EMC system, per item EMC value. I plan to attempt some form of programmatic EMC value adjustment based on item usage and demand. More on that later. 

Mining utilities from early to end game; 
Sounding rods and 3x3 pickaxes all the way to whatever that item was that just auto-mined a whole corridor or other shapes at once. 

Whatever that mod was that allowed survival friendly narrow scope worldedit style building. I.e. select material, shape or fill then use the item to build large shapes. 

Maybe look at uu matter style item locked behind large amount of material progression used to craft late-game items and processes. 

Automated crafting, farming, mining, smelting, storage etc. 

The cool rings like angel ring and the arrow one idk. 

and more!
