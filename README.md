# SBG
## Denizen 
A large portion of this repo is made up of live, in-dev and archived denizen scripting created or used by the SBG crew. 
### Project Workspaces:
#### [ProjectEV -  EE2 gang.](.../ProjectEV/)
An attempt to create a spiritual successor to the gameplay feel of the Tekkit Classic 1.2.5 modpack, plus some additional highlights from other past experiences.
The project looks to implement many of the standard or much-loved features, items and ideas I knew and loved, while not requiring anything but a vanilla java install!
#### [ProjectSP - The Server Points system](.../ProjectSP/)
An attempt to create a more in-depth, engaging and flexible player reward system. Currently in it's infancy, but is planned to be stored against a SQL server independent of any MC focus or dependency. The final product will creep well outside Denizen in it's scope, but is aimed to provide a recognition and reward system that isn't tied to a single game, application or server. 
#### [ProjectNB - Netblocks!](.../ProjectNB/)
A large set of tools and function libraries that aim to provide familiar game and map development tools in Minecraft. 
Think things like Source map trigger blocks and map logic, extendable script triggers and other fun tools. See the project README for more info. 
#### [ProjectPP - Expand dong](.../ProjectEV/)
Nah but seriously, this is planned as a player progression project that doesn't limit itself to forcing defined playstyles and arbitrary grinding on players. Watch this space, get bored, come back later!

### Standalone Categories:
#### [Core](.../core/)
Contains scripts/libraries that are independent, narrow in scope or are otherwise used but don't fall into any category. Needs a better name. 
#### [External Scripts](.../ext/)
Contains scripts/libraries that were either taken from other users (with consent!), or were commissioned and provided for us.
#### [Sandbox for Test and Development works](.../sandbox/)
Please create a folder with your MC account name to contain your scripts, and disable any script in these directories when not in use!
If I catch you leaving scripts enabled in here without you actively working on them, I will show you why I still have nightmares from StalkingTheHorse. 
#### [Archive for scripts/directories that are out of date, defunct or no longer in use.](.../archive/)
Please create a folder with your MC account name to contain your scripts/directories, and disable ALL scripts in these directories.
Never delete your work, even slapjob code from a wild friday night can come in handy. 
#### [The Pit](.../thepit)
Contains examples of nightmare code, insane ideas and otherwise schizophrenic comedy routines. (Always a copy, never save originals here)
If any of your work shows up here, don't be angry or ashamed, take it as a badge of honour and learn from the experience. Expect to see half my work replicated here. 
### General Requirements and Advice:
If you plan to use any Denizen content contained in this repo, please refer to each project or directory README for any specific instructions or dependencies. 

Ensure version parity with the version of Denizen being run on the SBG SMP, this is usually the most recent release.
Ensure dependencies are provided for any functions not handled natively by Denizen. I will attempt to note where this is required, but all servers using Denizen should consider installing Depenizen, Vault and Protocollib regardless. The [Denizen Meta Documentation](meta.denizenscript.com) and the [Denizen VS Code extension](https://github.com/DenizenScript/DenizenVSCode) do a good job at providing info on modules or commands that require additional components.

Try and have an understanding of what a script or set of scripts is achieving, the why and how. There are many ways to achieve outcomes, and the solutions in this repo are almost never the most efficient, stable or ideal way of doing things. I will always attempt to provide explanations and advice, and you're more than free to take things as is or pull them apart.

The one piece of advice I will give here and always though, try and take inspiration or knowledge from these examples to build your own solution. Even if it's just changing one or two parts of a script to understand how parts work, you will take away more than just dropping these in and treating them like a plugin or datapack.
