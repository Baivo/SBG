# capture all blocks within a 16 block radius from the player
        # store them into a grid of 16x16 blocks (256 blocks)
        # grid is a map location is the block location and material is the block material
        # grid is used to construct the 16x16 grid of blocks as text in chat for the player
        # each block is represented by a single uniqode square â– 
        # using the material of the block to determine the color of the square
        # color is a hex value of the material's texture color on it's surface
        # each tick, the grid is updated and sent to the player in chat
        # the grid is refreshed each tick so the player can see the blocks change as they walk around
