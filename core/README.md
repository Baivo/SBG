Scripts in this directory are small or independant features that don't belong under an existing project or category. 
Scripts may live here temporarily until they receive the rest of their planned content or features, or a better location is found to classify them against. 

For the most part, these scripts should theoretically work as drop-in ready scripts for any Denizen compatible server, unless otherwise stated in the script header info.
