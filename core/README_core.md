Scripts in this directory are small or independant features that don't belong under an existing project or category. 
Scripts may live here temporarily until they receive the rest of their planned content or features, or a better location is found to classify them against. 

For the most part, these scripts should theoretically work as drop-in ready scripts for any Denizen compatible server, though I would urge the following:

- Ensure version parity with the version of Denizen being run on the SBG SMP, this is usually the most recent release. 

- Ensure dependencies are provided for any functions not handled natively by Denizen. 
    I will attempt to note where this is required, but all servers using Denizen should consider installing Depenizen, Vault and Protocollib regardless. 
    The Denizen Meta Documentation [meta.denizenscript.com], and by extension the IntelliSense markup for denizen does a good job at providing info on modules or commands that require additional components. 
    
- Try and have an understanding of what a script or set of scripts is achieving, the why and how. 
    There are many ways to achieve outcomes, and the solutions in this repo are almost never the most efficient, stable or ideal way of doing things. 
    I will always attempt to provide explanations and advice, and you're more than free to take things as is or pull them apart. 
    
The one piece of advice I will give here and always though, try and take inspiration or knowledge from these examples to build your own solution. 
Even if it's just changing one or two parts of a script to understand how parts work, you will take away more than just dropping these in and treating them like a plugin or datapack.
